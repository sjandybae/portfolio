                            <p>For a 48 hour game jam, two peers and I challenged ourselves to build a game entirely from scratch using the game engine, <span class="t skill">Godot</span>. With the theme "Joined Together", we brainstormed and agreed on a concept where the player collects and commands a swarm of fighting units that must grow bigger and bigger to take on tougher enemies and bosses.</p>
                            <p>With one of my peers handling the main Godot programming and the other making pixel art for the whole game, I primarily contributed my skills in project management, being the team member most familiar with <span class="t skill">Git repositories</span>.</p>

                            <p>With only 48 hours to work, we had to quickly decide on the game's concept with a brainstorming session that took place over a Discord voice call. Some of our ideas included playable characters moving while physically linked together and setting up defensive towers on a shared power grid. We eventually decided to explore commandable allies commonly seen in real-time strategy games, simplified to a core loop where the player must recruit allies to conquer enemy groups with sheer force of numbers.</p>

                            <p>After I <span class="t skill">completed the C# scripts</span> needed for the viewer to move around a body of water, our team worked collectively to design the abandoned city the viewer will explore using mostly free assets available on the Unity Store. Since it was important that there was a clear path to where we wanted the viewer to see the ending, the buildings were arranged somewhat unrealistically to create a <span class="c skill">large forward path that could be followed</span> to reach the final destination.</p>

Since we wanted to generate a sense of discovery with these clues, we put them in <span class="c skill">separate side paths</span> branching from the main path so the viewer would have to explore to find them. To <span class="c skill">facilitate discovery</span> of these clues, we gave each of them looping sound effects such as car alarms or radio songs that would get louder as the viewer approached them.</p>

                            <p>Feedback we received during the first stages of development generally involved the environment’s layout. Our testers tended to get lost in the city, unsure of what our “main” path was, and reached areas that were not meant to be accessible. To resolve these issues, one of my team members added flashing lights to streetlights that were part of the main path, and I created barricades for openings between buildings surrounding the main and side paths, using objects such as flipped cars or cabinets to keep them interesting and <span class="c skill">relevant to the disaster-themed narrative</span>.</p>
                            <p>Other issues we encountered included frame rate drops, motion sickness, and glitches when traversing the obstacle ridden waters. Although I was able to <span class="t skill">adjust the scripts</span> to handle some glitches, we were unable to do much about the motion sickness as our narrative setting required the water to have mid-sized waves, which we discovered causes seasickness with or without the boat bobbing up and down with them.</p>

                            <p>The project was a great success at our class’s public showcase, especially due to our installation’s use of smelly beach tarps and a real inflatable boat to facilitate <span class="c skill">sensory immersion</span>. Our teaching staff were particularly impressed by the implementation of a <span class="c skill">deep, engaging narrative</span> about climate change, and the use of VR’s immersiveness to generate <span class="c skill">strong emotional reactions</span> towards this real-world issue.</p>
