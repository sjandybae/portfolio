                            <p>For a course in Virtual Reality, I worked with two peers to design a VR experience in which a user could explore an abandoned city partially submerged in water, steering a motorboat to find clues towards discovering the cause of the disaster. Our goal was to immerse the player as a character in our narrative and <span class="c skill">generate emotional responses from being lost and alone</span>.</p>
                            <p>As the team member most experienced in programming, I was responsible for <span class="t skill">creating the C# scripts</span>, including movement and interaction via the Oculus Rift and an Xbox 360 controller. In later phases of development, I created scripts for specific <span class="c skill">narrative events requiring animation</span> such as reticle scanning and water rising.</p>

                            <p>Through <span class="skill">affinity diagramming</span>, our team hovered around various ideas before narrowing down on an experience where the viewer explores a vast, mysterious environment via motorboat, especially to act as a solution to the Oculus Rift’s physical movement restrictions.</p>
                            <p>As our goal was also to implement a narrative that various clues in the environment will contribute towards, we made the setting of our experience be an abandoned, flooded city, not only for aesthetic purposes, but to create a <span class="skill">linear path of clues</span> for the player to follow before finally reaching the end. However, this proved to be a significant challenge for us as we wanted the viewer to be able to <span class="skill">move freely</span>, but also <span class="skill">follow our narrative</span> in a prompt and consistent pace.</p>

                            <p>After I <span class="t skill">completed the C# scripts</span> needed for the viewer to move around a body of water, our team worked collectively to design the abandoned city the viewer will explore using mostly free assets available on the Unity Store. Since it was important that there was a clear path to where we wanted the viewer to see the ending, the buildings were arranged somewhat unrealistically to create a <span class="c skill">large forward path that could be followed</span> to reach the final destination.</p>

Since we wanted to generate a sense of discovery with these clues, we put them in <span class="c skill">separate side paths</span> branching from the main path so the viewer would have to explore to find them. To <span class="c skill">facilitate discovery</span> of these clues, we gave each of them looping sound effects such as car alarms or radio songs that would get louder as the viewer approached them.</p>

                            <p>Feedback we received during the first stages of development generally involved the environment’s layout. Our testers tended to get lost in the city, unsure of what our “main” path was, and reached areas that were not meant to be accessible. To resolve these issues, one of my team members added flashing lights to streetlights that were part of the main path, and I created barricades for openings between buildings surrounding the main and side paths, using objects such as flipped cars or cabinets to keep them interesting and <span class="c skill">relevant to the disaster-themed narrative</span>.</p>
                            <p>Other issues we encountered included frame rate drops, motion sickness, and glitches when traversing the obstacle ridden waters. Although I was able to <span class="t skill">adjust the scripts</span> to handle some glitches, we were unable to do much about the motion sickness as our narrative setting required the water to have mid-sized waves, which we discovered causes seasickness with or without the boat bobbing up and down with them.</p>

                            <p>The project was a great success at our class’s public showcase, especially due to our installation’s use of smelly beach tarps and a real inflatable boat to facilitate <span class="c skill">sensory immersion</span>. Our teaching staff were particularly impressed by the implementation of a <span class="c skill">deep, engaging narrative</span> about climate change, and the use of VR’s immersiveness to generate <span class="c skill">strong emotional reactions</span> towards this real-world issue.</p>
