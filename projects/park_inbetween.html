                            <p>For a 7 day Halloween-themed game jam, two peers and I remotely teamed up to make a simple game using the <span class="t skill">Godot engine</span>. The end result was a simple 3D first-person shooter game where the player must navigate a mysterious, dark area haunted by deadly ghosts to find keys that will open the way to freedom.</p>
                            <p>I was invited to join as a <span class="c skill">game designer</span>, especially to use my <span class="t skill">project management</span> and <span class="t skill">Git repo management</span> skills to bring our team's collective work into a unified and complete game for our portfolios.</p>

                            <p>Brainstorming around the announced theme of “Afterlife”, we mostly considered core loops and mechanics centered around reincarnation, specifically in that your player avatar can “die” in the game, but this leads to the game continuing instead of ending. However, we backtracked upon realizing two things: our team’s overall familiarity with Godot was still new, and setting up other game elements to support the "fun" of a concept where the player must seek ways to essentially "lose" the game was out of scope. We ultimately decided to explore Godot’s 3D capabilities by creating a basic first-person shooter and expanding from there.</p>

                            <p>After completing the first person movement, we had another conversation to determine how to proceed with making the "game".

                            <p>From there, I recommended the team split into making basic required features (i.e. shooting and killing enemies, picking up items, GUI) and advanced creative features (i.e. "flat 3D" objects, rendering filters, enemy movement via NavMesh pathfinding) based on each teammate's interests and experience using Godot. This decision resulted in the whole team's familiarity with Godot and the project's specific code and assets getting <span class="c skill">synchronized in the first two days</span>, which I would later find was essential in bringing the project to completion in the final stretch.</p>
                            <p>In the final two days, I also got <span class="t skill">involved in the game's development</span> by sourcing and implementing some sound effects and 3D assets we were lacking.</p>

                            <p>The biggest obstacle we encountered late in development is that while all the features and objects were ready, there was no level design to help guide players towards the locations of the various keys. My idea was to have <span class="c skill">arrows on the ground discoverable with the flashlight</span>, and we attempted to implement a level design based on the terrain's layout. However, we realized early that it would be a long and difficult process due to the terrain's massive size.</p>

                            <p>With about 24 hours remaining, our teammate newest to Godot stepped up and created a level design from scratch by using simple planes and measuring how far the player can see with the flashlight at any given time. We then adjusted the terrain around this level design prototype, resulting in a solid game players can explore freely, yet encounter <span class="c skill">specific "scary" situations</span>, each carefully thought out with the placement of the key, its arrows, and the surrounding walls and enemies.</p>

                            <p>As the "game designer" of the project, I gained significant insight into the meaning of this role when the team reflected on the past week after our submission. We agreed that the level design should have been considered much earlier, but also that as game designer, it should have been up to me to <span class="c skill">pitch the initial game concept</span> based on everyone's interests. Since it was a game jam, I felt it was important to make sure everyone was having fun making what they wanted to make, but admittedly, this resulted in a very disorganized process as we each acted on our own ideas for technical features and gameplay moments.</p>
