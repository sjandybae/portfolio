The game jam's theme being "keep it alive", "Pitcher and the Whale" has the player control Pitcher, a little fox with a bucket exploring the mountainous area and bringing water back to a dehydrating whale.</p>

                            <p>As soon as we were introduced with the theme of “keep it alive”, our team used a digital whiteboard to brainstorm ideas that could work around our objective and pre-existing code towards making a platformer game. “Beached whale” ultimately stayed out of all of the ideas we explored, and we challenged the platformer convention of moving to a single destination by instead having multiple destinations, allowing for exploration, discovery, and strategizing as the player worked to bring water back to the beached whale to “keep it alive”.</p>

                            <p>As the game’s central figure was a whale and our team name was related to foxes, I suggested for us to use a vibrant, lighthearted vibe and aesthetic for our game, featuring animal characters, a playful narrative, and very minimal violence.

                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <p>In order to utilize pre-existing code and one of our team members’ pixel art skills, we used Gamemaker Studio 2 to make a simple, 2D platformer game. Since it was my first time using Gamemaker Studio 2, my involvement with the game programming was limited to GUI elements, balancing systems such as health and game timers, and iterating on the level design.</p>
                            <p>I was pleasantly surprised to see how simple it was to use tilesets and colliders to quickly adjust parts of the level, especially since level design was crucial to a non-linear platformer like this game, and playtesting revealed weaknesses and soft locks in its progression.</p>

                            <p>Since we were all working remotely, all of our collaboration was done through a Discord server and GitHub. As the sole team member with experience using GitHub, I explained its features to my team and was frequently involved with ensuring everyone’s work could be shared and resolved from merge conflicts. Since our team was highly motivated and coming up with various ideas for features and improvements, I also used my experience working with spreadsheets to organize, prioritize, and delegate all of the tasks we would need to complete in sequence to deliver a playable product for playtesting, and then the final submission at the end of the three day game jam.</p>

                            <p>Playtesting returned good feedback that made us direct all of our remaining time on improving the level design, especially in that we needed to equalize every pool of water’s distance from the whale, create secret shortcuts to discover, and add enemies to make returning buckets of water more fun and challenging. This resulted in our final game submission being surprisingly well-received, and many participants of the game jam left very positive feedback for our game’s aesthetics, physics, and twist on the platformer genre.</p>

                            <p>Our success with this game led our team to agree on continuing development on our game, specifically towards a formal release on Steam. While my involvement was mainly managerial, it was incredibly rewarding for me to see the physics and art assets made by my teammates receive praise. I also enjoyed using Gamemaker Studio 2 and made plans to work on solo projects with it after our team finishes the remaining features we could not include before the game jam’s deadline and re-releases the definitive version of “Pitcher and the Whale”.</p>
