                            <p>As a short-term personal project, I gave myself a time limit to make a visual novel, a simple narrative-focused game with dialogue options leading to alternate endings. This allowed me to quickly learn the limits of "Ren'Py", an engine based on <span class="t skill">Python</span>, and how to manage other parts of production such as sourcing music and commissioning artwork.</p>
                            <p>The game demo was successfully completed one week ahead of schedule, and has received an overall positive reception, primarily due to efforts marketing the game in itch.io and Reddit.</p>

                            <p>The whole story (including beyond the demo) was planned out in a Google Doc with detailed notes for key story beats and clues for the overarching mystery plot. I also what dialogue choices cause the story to diverge in this step.
                            </p>
                            <p>Using an application called "Custom Cast", I made early designs for what I imagined for the characters' appearances, and used PhotoShop to incorporate these designs as placeholder sprites during initial prototyping. Placeholder backdrop images were quickly found through online internet searches.</p>

                            <p>Within days, I quickly made a playable prototype in Ren'Py to implement and test the branching narrative system I had planned (i.e. which decisions would lead to which endings). Dialogue was written at a first draft level, and there were no facial expressions or music.</p>
                            <p>I opened a Git repo for backup purposes, as well as the ability to resume work on other devices. This repo would later become vital in development as a way to <span class="t skill">version visual and audio assets</span>, even if I was the sole contributor.</p>

                            <p>The first prototype ended in "failure" as all of my playtesters could barely reach one ending, and did not want to loop around and try to get other endings--which was in fact crucial for the story and game progression. The feedback I received instead revolved around <span class="c skill">improving player retention</span>, such as adding more dialogue options, make the speaker of the current dialogue line more obvious, etc. </p>
                            <p>As a visual novel’s “fun” is completely reliant on engaging with the text and story, improving player retention became top priority, if only as a means to truly test the core ideas of the gameplay and narrative.</p>

                            <p>With a self-imposed deadline of “the end of 2022”, I began a production pipeline with the goal of refining the prototype into a final playable demo that could be shared online. I <span class="c skill">planned scope carefully</span>, considering that this would be roughly 6 months of time and energy outside of my full-time day job.</p>
                            <p>Besides narrative, my work involved finding royalty-free music and sound effects online, crafting background art using <span class="c skill">Source Filmmaker</span> and <span class="c skill">PhotoShop</span>, and studying <span class="t skill">Python</span> and Ren'Py programming techniques to customize the experience from Ren'Py's defaults.</p>

                            <p>I organized this “art pipeline” to be parallel with my own work, using spreadsheets and mock-ups to communicate my ideas to the artists and track their progress over 6 months of production.</p>

                            <p>Editing and proofreading the dialogue was the final step of production as at this stage, facial expressions, visual effects, animations, sound effects, and music could be cued and directed as well. Even after adding entirely new dialogue and scenes, the script was finalized around the same time as final art assets were delivered, and the entire project was <span class="c skill">completed one week ahead of schedule</span>.</p>

                            <p>Marketing was done in the following month, involving Reddit, Twitter, and some contacts I had with YouTube and Twitch platforms. Initial downloads were dishearteningly minimal until a post in a specific community on Reddit brought it to almost 100 total downloads within a couple days. This became a lesson learned in <span class="c skill">strategically targeting a demographic</span> who would be most likely interested in the game’s specific genre.</p>
                            <p>In stark contrast to the first prototype, this demo engaged players long enough where several reported reaching all endings. A Google Form linked in the game provided me long awaited feedback on the story and gameplay structure, which includes several actionable suggestions that I intend to implement for the final, full release.</p>
