                            <p>For the Ludum Dare 46 game jam, three friends and I worked remotely on a platformer game from design to submission within 72 hours. "Pitcher and the Whale" has the player control Pitcher, a little fox with a bucket exploring the mountainous area and bringing water back to a dehydrating whale.</p>
                            <p>One of my teammates had the most experience working with <span class="t skill">GameMaker Studio 2</span>, so my role only involved some coding when I was not working on <span class="t skill">managing our team's tasks and production pipeline</span>, organizing playtesting sessions, collaborating on level design, and documenting our progress.</p>
                            <p><span class="c skill">Due to our love for this project</span>, after the game jam ended, we continued to work on it for three months, adding more features and improvements, all to eventually meet our goal of <span class="skill">publishing the game to Steam</span>.</p>

                            <p>As soon as we were introduced with the game jam's theme of ‚Äúkeep it alive‚Äù, our team used a digital whiteboard to brainstorm ideas that could work around our objective and pre-existing code towards making a platformer game. ‚ÄúBeached whale‚Äù ultimately stayed out of all of the ideas we explored, and we challenged the platformer convention of moving to a single destination by instead having multiple destinations, allowing for exploration, discovery, and strategizing as the player worked to bring water back to the beached whale to ‚Äúkeep it alive‚Äù.</p>

                            <p>As the game‚Äôs central figure was a whale and our team name was related to foxes, I suggested for us to use a vibrant, lighthearted vibe and aesthetic for our game, featuring animal characters, a playful narrative, and very minimal violence.

                            <p>In order to utilize pre-existing code and one of our team members‚Äô pixel art skills, we used Gamemaker Studio 2 to make a simple, 2D platformer game. Since it was my first time using Gamemaker Studio 2, my involvement with the game programming was limited to <span class="c skill">GUI elements</span>, <span class="c skill">balancing health and timer systems</span>, and iterating on the level design.</p>
                            <p>I was pleasantly surprised to see how simple it was to use tilesets and colliders to quickly adjust parts of the level, especially since <span class="c skill">level design was crucial</span> to a non-linear platformer like this game, and playtesting revealed weaknesses and soft locks in its progression.</p>

Since our team was highly motivated and coming up with various ideas for features and improvements, I also used my <span class="t skill">experience working with spreadsheets</span> to organize, prioritize, and delegate all of the tasks we would need to complete in sequence to deliver a playable product for playtesting, and then the final submission at the end of the three day game jam.</p>

                            <p>Our success with this game led our team to agree on continuing development on our game, specifically towards a formal release on Steam. I continued my role <span class="t skill">managing the project</span>, including setting deadlines, signing paperwork for Valve, and marketing our game on social media.</p>
                            <p>The three months leading up to the Steam release were essentially an extension of our game jam work, especially since we discussed and implemented <span class="c skill">significant game design changes</span> such as new abilities, power-ups, and win-lose conditions. I also did a little more <span class="t skill">programming work</span> by creating the menu and cutscene systems, while we commissioned other creatives to work on music and logo art.</p>

                            <p>While my involvement was mainly managerial, it was <span class="skill">incredibly rewarding for me</span> to see the physics and art assets made by my teammates receive praise. As the first game I have ever formally published, it was an amazing feeling to see people post reviews, make playthrough videos, and basically acknowledge our work as a real part of game consumer culture.</p>
                            <p>An important lesson we learned from this project, however, is on the limitations of passion. While we all wanted to make this game the best it could be for Steam, it was ultimately a passion project seperated from education and employment, and we had to make some compromises in order to let it reach completion.</p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, we all took great pride in this achievement and agreed that "Pitcher and the Whale" would be the first of many games we will make in our respective gamemaking careers.</p>
