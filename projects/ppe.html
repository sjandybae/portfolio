                            <p>In response to COVID-19, Virtro began developing a simulation for healthcare workers to practice putting on and taking off Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) correctly, and assigned me the role of <span class="c skill">experience designer</span>. My technical knowledge on our AI-driven dialogue system was especially needed to create a proposal that covers from start to finish what the user will experience, how we could <span class="t skill">utilize our current technology</span>, and how it would meet all of our project objectives.</p>
                            <p>After my design proposal was approved, I would continue to support developers during the production phase by clarifying requirements for each milestone, reviewing client and tester feedback with my superiors, and updating different departments whenever the design documentation needed to be changed. My other role in the project was to develop the AI-driven character dialogue and ensure our systems were providing dialogue and other data to the simulation accurately and efficiently.</p>

                            <h3>Design</h3>
                            <p>To write the design proposal, I collaborated closely with the lead developer to ensure that the technical components are realistic and feasible for the time frame we were given. With voice commands and AI being integral to the experience, we needed to account for practically every possibility and how it would still be possible to reach the intended beats and ending. Therefore, I opted to create a flowchart that would demonstrate the linear experience and prove the design’s compatibility with our current technology.</p>

                            <h3>Production</h3>
                            <p>My main contribution to the simulation’s content was the character dialogue and AI setup. I was provided detailed backstories to implement in the characters’ voices, speech patterns, and dialogue pertaining to their personal lives. The result was not only users having realistic and engaging conversations, but experiencing an accurate representation of workplace diversity in healthcare.</p>
                            <p>Since the design required the development of new features and systems, I communicated regularly with many developers, especially to clarify the exact goals of each feature and <span class="t skill">how to utilize existing systems</span> to make it work. I would also <span class="c skill">relay issues, decisions, and milestones</span> to developers, QA, and management to minimize delays and misunderstandings as much as possible.</p>

                            <p>From early user feedback, it was clear that the simulation was proving to be very valuable to those in healthcare dealing directly with COVID-19. It was very satisfying for me to see how quickly all of the developers’ work fell into place and became a real immersive experience where people could speak with the characters and be in that moment.</p>
                            <p>While there were a few times during production where I felt that I could have relayed information sooner or more accurately, these are now valuable learning experiences to inform my future work facilitating communication across members of a team. For the most part, I am confident that my support for my co-workers was effective, and that we can all take pride in the components we each worked on to bring this simulation to life.</p>
